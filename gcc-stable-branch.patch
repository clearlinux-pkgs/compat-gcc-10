+From 6607bdd99994c834f92fce924abdaea3405f62dc Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
+From: "H.J. Lu" <hjl.tools@gmail.com>
+Date: Fri, 1 May 2020 21:03:10 -0700
+Subject: [PATCH] Add patch_area_size and patch_area_entry to crtl
+
+Currently patchable area is at the wrong place.  It is placed immediately
+after function label and before .cfi_startproc.  A backend should be able
+to add a pseudo patchable area instruction durectly into RTL.  This patch
+adds patch_area_size and patch_area_entry to crtl so that the patchable
+area info is available in RTL passes.
+
+It also limits patch_area_size and patch_area_entry to 65535, which is
+a reasonable maximum size for patchable area.
+
+gcc/
+
+	PR target/93492
+	* cfgexpand.c (pass_expand::execute): Set crtl->patch_area_size
+	and crtl->patch_area_entry.
+	* emit-rtl.h (rtl_data): Add patch_area_size and patch_area_entry.
+	* opts.c (common_handle_option): Limit
+	function_entry_patch_area_size and function_entry_patch_area_start
+	to USHRT_MAX.  Fix a typo in error message.
+	* varasm.c (assemble_start_function): Use crtl->patch_area_size
+	and crtl->patch_area_entry.
+	* doc/invoke.texi: Document the maximum value for
+	-fpatchable-function-entry.
+
+gcc/c-family/
+
+	PR target/12345
+	* c-attribs.c (handle_patchable_function_entry_attribute): Limit
+	value to USHRT_MAX (65535).
